ISO-3166 Countries and Continents as SQL
===

This is an SQL file with two tables of continents and countries, and their ISO-3166 codes.


"The Story"
---

Needed one a while ago, but the ones I found were either kind of lacking or kind of old. So I made one myself by converting a [datafile on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_soveriegn_states_and_dependent_territories_by_continent_(data_file)) into the SQL format I wanted via some regular expressions and manual corrections.

Aso went through all the newsletters with [Updates on ISO 3166](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/updates_on_iso_3166.htm) I found, and subscribed to their newsletter myself to try keep it up to date as well. Hopefully I've gotten it all right, and hopefully it can be useful for both future me and others.

If you find any mistakes or updates I've missed, _please let me know_ 🙂👍
